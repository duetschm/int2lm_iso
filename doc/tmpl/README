Compiler Templates
==================

This directory contains templates for compiling on other platforms or
using other compilers. Note that these files are not maintained and
not tested. They serve solely to get you up to speed more quickly than
if you would have had to start from scratch. Please test!

Note: If you want to use any of these templates on the Cray systems at
 CSCS, you should edit the compiler name to be "ftn" and load the
 corresponding modules.
